# Markdown Cheatsheet
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

## 1. Paragraphs
A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more `blank lines`.

## 2. Headers
Headings from `h1` through `h6` are constructed with a `#` for each level:
- **H1**: `# your-text-here`
- **H2**: `## your-text-here`
- **H6**: `###### your-text-here`

## 3. Emphasis
Change the appearance of your text.
- To make text **bold** use: `**your-text-here**`
- To make text *italic* use: `*your-text-here*`
- To make text ~~strike through~~ use: `~~your-text-here~~`

## 4. Lists
Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.
- Unordered lists use: `*`, `-`, `+`
- Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods: `1.`

## 5.  Blockquotes
Markdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting.
- regular blocquote: `> your-text-her`
- nested blocquote: `> > your-text-her`

## 6. Code block
- To produce a code block in Markdown, indent every line of the block by at least `4 spaces` or `1 tab`
- To indicate a span of code, wrap it with `backtick quotes`

## 7. Horizontal rules
A line dividing the document. In Markdown, you can create a it with any of the following:
- `---`
- `___`
- `***`

## 8. Links
- To create an **inline** link use: `[display-name](url)`
- To create an **reference** link use: `[display-name][id]` then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like: `[id]: http://example.com/`

## 9. Images
To create image use the links syntax with exclamation mark in front like `![image-alt-text](/path/to/img.jpg)`
